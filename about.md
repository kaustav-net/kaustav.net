Hello, my name is **Kaustav Ghosh** and I'm a **Software Engineer** from India. Currently, I'm working at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/) in Tallinn. I am passionate about **Real-Time Communication**, **Android Open Source Project** and **Linux Kernel**. Over the past few years, I have also worked on **web and mobile application development**. 

In my spare time, you'll find me watching football matches (a big fan of FC Barcelona), listening to music, and playing video games. I can speak English, Bengali, and Hindi. Recently I joined a language class to learn Estonian.

Earlier, I worked at [Tonbo Imaging](https://tonboimaging.com/), and [Tata Consultancy Services](https://www.tcs.com/) and was an intern at [Confirmtkt](https://www.confirmtkt.com/).
